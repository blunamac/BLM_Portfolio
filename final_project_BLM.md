# Hispanic Aging Population and the Aging Network

## Outline: 
**Summary:**

The growing Hispanic older adult population will require additional services and supports to age with dignity, safety and comfort. 

**Setup:**

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, minorities will soon make up a quarter of the 65 + segment of the U.S. population. The Latino population will make up the largest portion of this segment, totaling 22% by 2060. This Latino community is composed of low-income, working class individuals who have poorer health care outcomes (I might touch on this in a vizualization). With a diversifying older adult population we have additional considerations when it comes to policy making.

**Conflict:**

- income across race- pictogram [Data Source](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.html) & Hispanic women income inequity [Data Source](http://www.equalpaytoday.org/latina-equal-pay-day-2021)

In a compelling way, I will show how the Hispanic population earns below the national median houeshold income level. I will highlight the gender income inequity within this particular group. Folks earn less and this translates into financial instability in the long-run. 


-  hispanics have highest rate of caregiving compared to other groups- pictogram of what these hours would be able to buy you compared to other groups [Data Source](http://www.nhcoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Final-Proceedings-Caregiving-Thought-Leaders-Roundtable-Washington-DC-1.pdf)

Hispanics tend to provide more hours of care when compared to other groups. This translates to unpaid hours of labor. There is, and will continue to be, a need for paid caregiving that we have yet to fund on a federal level. With a growing older adult population, the Hispanic population will experience a spill over effect of unmet needs in helping their loved ones age where they are happiest, in their community. For this, my vision is to picture the unpaid hours of labor into items folks would have been able to buy if they were in fact paid hours. I envision a grocery bag or bags representing dollar amount across groups.

- Hispanics hold the largest share of undocumented immigrants- [Data Source](http://madreanna.org/immref/pew/107Full.pdf)

One’s immigration status determines their eligibility for federally funded programs like Medicaid, Medicare and social security. These are programs that older adults heavily rely on. I want to touch on this point because these folks don’t have a piece of that pie and face uncertainty because of it. I will show this in another pictogram for every x amount of people there are x amount of undocumented Hispanics (who probably have families who they will rely on to make up for being barred from social policy because of their status.).

**Resolution:**
- funding stagnant, even during covid for aging and disability programs under Older Americans Act- line graph [Data Source](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43414)

The programs funded under the Older Americans Act are not entitlement programs. These programs can be accessed by anyone regardless of status. They are administered my Area Agencies on Aging, who serve as hubs connecting individuals to local resources to help folks age in place. We cans see that funding has been stagnant, despite the great value it brings to communities. To drive my point home, I will show this in a line graph across the years.
