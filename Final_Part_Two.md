## Unpaid labor in the form of careing for an older adult adds up when household median income is $38,600.

## Retirement Wealth

## Hispanics make up the largest share of undocumented immigrants 
This excludes them from any entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. These are vital parts of our social safety net in old age.  <br />

In conclusion, this demographic needs greater considerations for policy measures that aim at alleviating uncertainty for them and their families as they enter the golden age. As future policy makers, I ask that you consider the layers of inequity behind policies that are framed as universal. 



### Write-up
In reviewing part one, I made some changes to better refine my final project. I want to look at aging policy, zoom into the Hispanic population and tell the story of the unique barriers this population faces when it comes to aging in the U.S. 

First, I intend to set the scene with some basic demographic data. Looking at population growth over the years, state distribution and projections on Hispanic older adults future population growth. 

**Population growth as a line graph using Flourish:**

**State distribution as a choropleth map using Tableau:**

[Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=race%20over%20years&g=0400000US01,04,05,06,08,09,10,12,13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,53,54,55,56&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P2)


**Hispanic older adult projections as a line graph using Flourish:**

Then I will take viewers through the conflict. I am trying to build a case for this through the visualization, so then folks will come to realize that there are problems in aging that this community faces. Together, we will filter through the layers of inequity these folks face by highlighting gender pay gap and how that could rolls over into lower retirement wealth. The cherry on top is the fact that Hispanics make up the largest share of undocumented immigrants in the U.S.

**Why does it matter to my audience?** <br /> 
My audience for this project is policy and management students. I want folks to be able to use their sociological imagination when trying to understand/ make policy. We must be able to tap into a critical race perspective or take on a feminist perspective and apply them to these kind of ‘universal’ policy topics to see the layers of inequity in them. We are all going to age and for some its going to look a lot different. My ask is for folks to commit to thinking critically about aging policy and for them to see its intersectionality. I want folks to begin to scratch their heads at social issues and begin to imagine the layers beneath. 

**Method and Medium** <br /> 
To complete this assignment, I will use a combination of tools we learned in this course. I will use tableau to complete the choropleth map portion of this assignment. We did a similar exercise in class and I feel good about being able to pull the data set I have into Tableau to create my vision. For most of the line graphs, I will use flourish. This will make it easier since Tableau can be a bit tricky. For the median income level over time, I will add a slider option to add the overall median income level over time. In Tableau, I will visualize the bar charts I have planned. I will also use Tableau to create a pictogram bar chart for the ‘unpaid labor for care’ chart. I will try to see if there is a nice template on Flourish for this, but if not, I will most likely use Tableau. For the wage gap visualization and the unpaid labor visualization, I will use canvas. I like this platform and have used it before. This would be the best platform to make these on since they’re more pictogram style visualizations. I can use some of their free images to recreate my sketches.

To reach my target population, I will ask folks for interviews in the HBH cafeteria. This area is frequented by fellow Heinzers who are currently studying policy at CMU. 

**interview script** <br /> 
*Hey, 
My name is Brenda Luna Macedo. I am a second year MSPPM student here at Heinz. We’ve probably ran into each other while eating lunch and doing homework in the study rooms here around the corner. I was wondering if I could tell you a story through pictures and perhaps get some feedback? We could do this while you eat if you’d like. This is for a class of mine and shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes of your time. 
-tell story-
How compelling was my story telling and where could there be room for improvement in terms of the narrated portion?
How understandable would you rate the images? Was there any that stood out for good or bad reasons? Please provide details.
Were the captions of the images helpful or in need of revision for clarity?
Did the order of the story make sense or is there room for reworking?*

### Findings:
How compelling was my story telling and where could there be room for improvement in terms of the narrated portion?
Person 1:  Did not know anything about my topic before speaking. Work on transitions. Compelling, but tie it together so people like him can follow. 
Person 2: Speak slower. My interest in the topic makes her interested. Try having notes on hand or practice your flow better. Story is interesting.
Person 3: This person was confused and needed for me to go through it again. They got it the second time. Interesting story, but needs work in delivery because there are international students who don’t know U.S.  <br /> 
How understandable would you rate the images? Was there any that stood out for good or bad reasons? Please provide details.
Person 1: Once done, they will be good. They help with the story. Unpaid labor needs more to understand it better. Hispanic share of undocumented immigrants stood out.
Person 2: Projected population growth is good. Are numbers right? Unpaid labor could be better to understand. Looks like people are being sold for a bag of money. The fact it wants to show is compelling.
Person 3: Clearer second time around because needed to understand context. Liked the density map. Maybe explain why people live in those states. Trouble understanding the unpaid labor hours one. Picture is not clear to quickly understand. <br /> 
Were the captions of the images helpful or in need of revision for clarity?
Person 1: Unpaid labor. Fine tune it by changing words to visual. 
Person 2: Projected population, explain the percentages. Unpaid labor image, maybe more text can help.
Person 3: Hispanics from where? This can help people understand what Hispanic means. Work on unpaid labor and write in a sentence for density map. <br /> 
Did the order of the story make sense or is there room for reworking?
Person 1: Order is fine. 
Person 2: Placing projected population growth at the end can make everything before it even more shocking, but ok the way it is now. 
Person 3: Order works as is, bring the context in captions or when speaking.  <br /> 

### Changes to be made:
Finish up last two sketches on Hispanic population growth and retirement wealth. I presented without and folks seemed to still understand, but I feel like it would be more compelling to add that additional line graph and bar chart. I need to rework some captions on the percentages in population growth, unpaid labor and consider adding what Hispanic entails in the undocumented immigrants visualization. The biggest thing I must do is rework the unpaid labor hours image. It was misleading and not very clear to folks. I need to look at how others have visualized things similar to this and work it out into my image. I’m leaning to make a single bar chart representing total median income and overlaying the value of those hours would be over the course of one year. This will better lay out the opportunity cost. Folks give up making this amount because they need to care for older adults at home. This image takes so much context to explain and now I’m understanding why the report I pulled these stats from didn’t create an image for it. Its so layered. The last thing I must do is slow down when speaking and have clear talking points. I’m going to narrow down exactly what I will touch on for my presentation and practice for this. I get a bit excited when speaking about this that I almost skip over things.
