In conclusion, this demographic needs greater considerations for policy measures that aim at alleviating uncertainty for them and their families as they enter the golden age. As future policy makers, I ask that you consider the layers of inequity behind policies that are framed as universal. 



### Write-up
In reviewing part one, I made some changes to better refine my final project. I want to look at aging policy, zoom into the Hispanic population and tell the story of the unique barriers this population faces when it comes to aging in the U.S. 

First, I intend to set the scene with some basic demographic data. Looking at population growth over the years, state distribution and projections on Hispanic older adults future population growth.
