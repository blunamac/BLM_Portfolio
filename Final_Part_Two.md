## The Hispanic population have a long history of being lower income.

## Within this demographic there is a gender pay gap.

## Unpaid labor in the form of careing for an older adult adds up when household median income is $38,600.

## Retirement Wealth

## Hispanics make up the largest share of undocumented immigrants 
This excludes them from any entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. These are vital parts of our social safety net in old age.  <br />

In conclusion, this demographic needs greater considerations for policy measures that aim at alleviating uncertainty for them and their families as they enter the golden age. As future policy makers, I ask that you consider the layers of inequity behind policies that are framed as universal. 



### Write-up
In reviewing part one, I made some changes to better refine my final project. I want to look at aging policy, zoom into the Hispanic population and tell the story of the unique barriers this population faces when it comes to aging in the U.S. 

First, I intend to set the scene with some basic demographic data. Looking at population growth over the years, state distribution and projections on Hispanic older adults future population growth. 

**Population growth as a line graph using Flourish:**

**State distribution as a choropleth map using Tableau:**

[Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=race%20over%20years&g=0400000US01,04,05,06,08,09,10,12,13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,53,54,55,56&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P2)


**Hispanic older adult projections as a line graph using Flourish:**

Then I will take viewers through the conflict. I am trying to build a case for this through the visualization, so then folks will come to realize that there are problems in aging that this community faces. Together, we will filter through the layers of inequity these folks face by highlighting gender pay gap and how that could rolls over into lower retirement wealth. The cherry on top is the fact that Hispanics make up the largest share of undocumented immigrants in the U.S.

**Why does it matter to my audience?** <br /> 
My audience for this project is policy and management students. I want folks to be able to use their sociological imagination when trying to understand/ make policy. We must be able to tap into a critical race perspective or take on a feminist perspective and apply them to these kind of ‘universal’ policy topics to see the layers of inequity in them. We are all going to age and for some its going to look a lot different. My ask is for folks to commit to thinking critically about aging policy and for them to see its intersectionality. I want folks to begin to scratch their heads at social issues and begin to imagine the layers beneath. 

**Method and Medium** <br /> 
To complete this assignment, I will use a combination of tools we learned in this course. I will use tableau to complete the choropleth map portion of this assignment. We did a similar exercise in class and I feel good about being able to pull the data set I have into Tableau to create my vision. For most of the line graphs, I will use flourish. This will make it easier since Tableau can be a bit tricky. For the median income level over time, I will add a slider option to add the overall median income level over time. In Tableau, I will visualize the bar charts I have planned. I will also use Tableau to create a pictogram bar chart for the ‘unpaid labor for care’ chart. I will try to see if there is a nice template on Flourish for this, but if not, I will most likely use Tableau. For the wage gap visualization and the unpaid labor visualization, I will use canvas. I like this platform and have used it before. This would be the best platform to make these on since they’re more pictogram style visualizations. I can use some of their free images to recreate my sketches.

To reach my target population, I will ask folks for interviews in the HBH cafeteria. This area is frequented by fellow Heinzers who are currently studying policy at CMU. 

**interview script** <br /> 
*Hey, 
My name is Brenda Luna Macedo. I am a second year MSPPM student here at Heinz. We’ve probably ran into each other while eating lunch and doing homework in the study rooms here around the corner. I was wondering if I could tell you a story through pictures and perhaps get some feedback? We could do this while you eat if you’d like. This is for a class of mine and shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes of your time. 
-tell story-
How compelling was my story telling and where could there be room for improvement in terms of the narrated portion?
How understandable would you rate the images? Was there any that stood out for good or bad reasons? Please provide details.
Were the captions of the images helpful or in need of revision for clarity?
Did the order of the story make sense or is there room for reworking?*
