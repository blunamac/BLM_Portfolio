In putting together my shorthand page, I was able to formulate a story that I am proud of. I was so passionate about this topic, that my initial webpage language was starting to sound a little too poetic. In better understanding my audience, I knew I needed to move away from this and take a bit of a different tone. I started out my story by laying down some foundational background information. From the feedback I received from my peers, I was able to see that not many folks are completely familiar with my topic. In doing this, I included some basic facts and an introduction to the issue at hand. I wanted avoid pointing folks in too many directions by including visualized statistics on Hispanic population growth and state population density. I’d initially intended to add these to further supplement the background information portion of my story, but I didn’t want to pull away from the topic of aging. To better condense this and avoid confusion from going to far off topic, I instead called out the total Hispanic population statistic. I gave this its own section. It was nice, simple and more concise than what I’d initially had planned.  <br /> 


I then went into the income statistics. I originally wanted to display the median household income, but when making my visualization, I thought why not use the average instead. I then realized that this would skew the data because of the ranges of income and the number of outliers. This would have made it seem like folks were better off than they actually were. So in my data visualization draft I had on flourish, I was able to simply switch out the numbers to reflect median income instead. It made a huge difference. Creating this specific visualization using the census data, I will be more critical of what race in similar visualizations that use the same dataset. The census separates race in many ways like: black, black alone, black alone or in combination etc. What I did was only use the ‘alone’ option to render my visualization, since I thought that this would be best reflective of what I wanted to show.  <br /> 


For the gender pay gap visualization, I had a lot of fun making this on canva. I’m really happy how this turned out, its simple, clean and easy to understand right away. I considered adding some markings to show where other women were on here, but I thought that would be too noisy. This number in itself is shocking enough and showing comparisons wouldn’t have added any additional value, because of the already present shock factor.  What I did instead was add some language alluding that the overall gender pay gap is 25 cents more than what Hispanic women make. <br /> 


 I had the hardest time in reworking the unpaid labor visualization. My initial idea of remaking this was to make a single bar chart representing total median income and overlaying the value of those hours would be over the course of one year. I then thought that it might be a smidge too much going on and wouldn’t convey the message as quickly as I’d like. So, I used canva and to rework this closer to my initial sketch. I had a happy accident of adding the arrow to point to what providing this many hours of care means. With some added language, I was able to get my point across. I have to say, this is the visualization that I am most proud of. It came out looking clean and professional (if I might add).  <br /> 
 
 
When creating the financial security in older age visualization, I wanted to make the jargonized data from the report to be easily understandable. Nothing would have been missed if I’d left the jargon out of the description, so I did. The descriptive caption is distilled from what the numbers the report churned from their layered methodology. 
The undocumented immigrant visualization was very straight forward and easy to make on flourish. I actually had a harder time in what language to use in in the caption. I was going back and forth between undocumented immigrant or unauthorized immigrant. I wanted to be as respectful as I could and not add to the seemingly normalized dehumanization of a community. I settled with undocumented immigrants. Although I think once unauthorized immigrant is a better reflection of their status, I don’t think its caught on just yet for folks to understand what I mean.  <br /> 


The projected population growth of Hispanic older adults was made on canva. It was overall painless to recreate my sketch. The only thing I had trouble with was positioning the percentages over the bars so they’d be centered. I did my best, but canva only allowed me to really eyeball it. I am happy with how this one turned out as well and I think it’s the most compelling visualization. <br /> 


 The way that I laid out my story from one visualization to another was to build on the conflict. I needed to make my value proposition to my audience, as to convince them that something must me done sooner rather than later. I want to concern readers, without being overly dramatic and grim. I think I did this well. 
One thing the other versions of my project was missing was a strong call to action. I really wanted folks to start thinking of how aging policy is incredibly intersectional. I wanted to bring home the fact that social programs are deceivingly passed on as universal, when they’re not. It wouldn’t have been enough to ask folks to start thinking about these things differently. It wouldn’t be enough to ask folks to believe that aging is the underground revolution and for us to start making it a hot issue. This wouldn’t have been actionable enough, so I decided to ask folks to help tackle the most challenging hardship the aging Hispanic population has right now: immigration reform. This has been highly debated for years and it will take a lot for things to change. I wanted to ask folks to help out with donations to a national advocacy group to supplement the momentum they’ve had.  <br />

So lets talk aging, lets look at some structural inequities that will make it tough on folks to enter the golden age with comfort.
 For this, I wanted to focus on the Hispanic population.
This community is made up of low-income, working class individuals.
 To make things worse, Hispanic women are valued way less for their work.
We know that caring for an older adult comes with a great opportunity cost and this community feels it a higher degree. 
This all accumulates to this population being at the highest risk when it comes to financial security in old age. 
To add fuel to the fire, Hispanics make up the largest share of undocumented immigrants. For these folks, there is no safety net. 
All this matters because the Hispanic older adult population is growing. It is essential that we consider this community’s unique circumstances and in anticipation, proactively create equitable policy change.
 What I ask for folks to do today is to help tackle the greatest challenge this community faces, immigration reform. Visit UnitedWeDream.org today and donate. Let’s help deliver a dignified golden age for everyone.
