### Methods:
I choose to create the last two data visualizations to better tell the story of how the U.S. is under a lot of debt, compared to its neighbors. In the North American Countries vs. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Global Average visualization, I wanted to give a better close up of the line chart we created using OECD’s dataset. I wanted folks to be able to see all 4 categories of locations side by side. I also wanted them to be able to click through to see even closer up of each chart one by one. This will enable folks to see the ebb and flow of the curve through the years. Besides this, I kept it minimalistic to not distract the reader from the message. If I could change one thing, I’d change the color of the OECD to orange. This would make it stand out for further comparison of where each country compares with the global average. I would have also spelled out the countries name. We had the space and it would have helped with understanding what we’re reading better. I, unfortunately, could not figure out how to do this on the platform. 
In the following data visualization, I created a pictogram of the 2019 debt-GDP ratio of each North American county and the global average. I did this with the intention of helping with clarity and cognition. I know not everyone understands what in the would debt-GDP is, here I am at least communicating some measure of spending. Folks will be able to get the message that the taller the bar of coins, the more money is slipping out of our pockets. The icons were a great, fun way to show this singular number for the 2019 year. I would have also liked to manipulate color here to contrast the control bar of global ratio and the other countries. I would have also liked to order these (geographically with Canada, U.S., Mexico and control last or in descending order). I have a vision, but need to master flourish better.
